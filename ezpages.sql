You will see that the qualities of these flours are reflected in the nature and abilities of the marsupials they take their names from. Our founder Friedrich Laucke always remarked how interesting and special the marsupial animals of Australia were and our company wants to reflect that connection by milling flour that achieves a real difference to the product it eventually makes.

In the early 1900''s it was Thomas Jefferson Clark who first discovered the remains of an ancient rain forest.
